# ytinfo
 a simple python script that will prompt for a list of youtube video urls, separated by new lines, which will then return the channel name, title, runtime, and url of each to the clipboard.

 i use a text editor for notetaking and I like to format my notes this way. I found it time consuming to copy this information from each youtube video page. 
 
 this script makes use of pytube (https://github.com/pytube/pytube) and pyperclip (https://github.com/asweigart/pyperclip) and urllib (https://github.com/node-modules/urllib)
